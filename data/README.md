### How to download data


The *olist.db* SQLite database file is too large (~66 MB) to be uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, you can download it at this link:

**[olist.db](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PIyBxWCT2pTjd2GH-qda1nu5XAGgkGGZ/view?usp=sharing)**

csv files with individual tables can be found on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
